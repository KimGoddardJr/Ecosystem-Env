# Ecosystem-Env
Ecosystem is a cross-platform environment management system from [Peregrine Labs](http://peregrinelabs.com) originally developed for VFX/Animation production R&D but could be used in any situation where a fine understanding of your working environment is important (and it really should be!). 
 
Please refer to the [https://github.com/PeregrineLabs/Ecosystem](https://github.com/PeregrineLabs/Ecosystem) for more details.

This repository contains all of the .env files as required by Ecosystem and may be forked/updated as you see fit.
